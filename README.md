## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd Social-Network-API
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up the MongoDB database:

   - Make sure you have MongoDB installed and running on your system.
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
   - Add the following line to the `.env` file, replacing `<your-mongodb-uri>` with your MongoDB connection URI:

     ```plaintext
     MONGODB_URI=<your-mongodb-uri>
     ```

5. Start the server:

   ```shell
   npm start
   ```

   The server should now be running at `http://localhost:3001`.

## Usage

You can test the API endpoints using a tool like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [cURL](https://curl.se/). The API supports the following operations:

- Create, update, and delete users.
- Create, update, and delete thoughts.
- Create and delete reactions for thoughts.
- Add and remove friends for users.

Make sure to include the appropriate request headers and request bodies when interacting with the API.

## Endpoints

The API provides the following endpoints:

- **Users**
  - `POST /api/users` - Create a new user.
  - `PUT /api/users/:id` - Update a user.
  - `DELETE /api/users/:id` - Delete a user.

- **Thoughts**
  - `POST /api/thoughts` - Create a new thought.
  - `PUT /api/thoughts/:id` - Update a thought.
  - `DELETE /api/thoughts/:id` - Delete a thought.

- **Reactions**
  - `POST /api/thoughts/:thoughtId/reactions` - Create a new reaction for a thought.
  - `DELETE /api/thoughts/:thoughtId/reactions/:reactionId` - Delete a reaction from a thought.

- **Friends**
  - `POST /api/users/:userId/friends` - Add a new friend for a user.
  - `DELETE /api/users/:userId/friends/:friendId` - Remove a friend from a user.

Replace `:id`, `:thoughtId`, `:reactionId`, and `:userId` in the endpoints with the corresponding IDs of the resources.

For detailed information about the request payloads and responses, refer to the API documentation or the source code.
